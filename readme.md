## Devlog

### `6/25/2024`
- `0.0.2`: Implement local, hidden `.env`
- `0.0.1`: Initially connected to DB by creating an "API User" called `caller` with limited permissions
    - (!!!) Allowed to access DB from anywhere (`%`)
    - Stored independent `index-001.js` outside of `Git` since it contained passwords
- `test db connection`
- `define, add model; create a user`
    - user-creation was hardcoded for testing
- `create a GET route`

### `6/26/2026`
